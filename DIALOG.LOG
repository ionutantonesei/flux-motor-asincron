     DEFINITION OF BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
NOTE : describe boundary conditions ANTICLOCKWISE
   (EXCEPT for an internal hole which is described clockwise)
Color codes. (solid square = reference point)
   RED       : Dirichlet condition
   YELLOW    : floating condition
   MAGENTA   : cyclic condition
   GREEN     : anticyclic condition
   CYAN      : translation condition
   TURQUOISE : periodic condition (A.exp(J.phi))
Boundary condition type
Please select the starting point
Please select the ending point
Do you want to define the values by a user's program ?
